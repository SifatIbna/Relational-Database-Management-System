# Postgre SQL 

PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. Here we will discuss how to install and use postgre sql in details.


# Installation

PostgreSQL is an open source RDBMS ( Relational Management System) , available for Windows, Mac, Linux distribution.


## Windows Installation

For windows installation you have to follow threes steps :

- Download PostgreSQL installer for Windows
- Install PostgreSQL
- Verify the installation


### Download Postgresql installer for windows

From Postgresql official page 32 bit and 64 bit installer is available. From there download the installer and the rest is pretty much easy follow.

- One or Two things you have to remember though.
  If you follow the installation instruction , then after some step the installer will ask you to give passwords. Remember it's for default **superuser** named **postgres**.

- Next the installer ask you to set a port. The default port of PostgreSQL is 5432. You need to make sure that no other applications are using this port.

To check if the installation is complete or not. Search for **psql** in windows search bar. If see a **SQL SHELL** , then the installation is complete.

Second, enter all the necessary information such as the server, database, port, username, and password. To accept the default, you can press **Enter**. Note that you should provide the password that you entered during installing the PostgreSQL.

```console
Server [localhost]: (leave it blank or enter localhost, then press Enter)
Database [postgres]: (leave it blank or enter postgres, then Press Enter)
Port [5432]: (leave it blank or enter 5432, then Press Enter)
Username [postgres]: (leave it blank or enter postgres, then Press Enter)
Password for user postgres: (Give your password)
psql (12.3) 
WARNING: Console code page (437) differs from Windows code page (1252) 
		 8-bit characters might not work correctly. See psql reference page 
		 "Notes for Windows users" for details. Type "help" for help. 
postgres=#
```

**Third**, issue the command `SELECT version();` you will see the following output:

## Linux installation

Linux installation is different than windows installation. Here's how can you install postgreSQL in Linux Distribution. I am using UBUNTU 18.04 . But the command lines are pretty much same for other distribution.

- Create the file repository configuration: 

```console
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
```

- Import the repository signing key:

```console
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

-  Update the package lists:

```console
sudo apt-get update
```

- Install the latest version of PostgreSQL. If you want a specific version, use **postgresql-12** or similar instead of **postgresql** :

```console
sudo apt-get install postgresql
```

It will take few minutes to download and install the PostgreSQL.

###  Connect to the PostgreSQL database server via psql

In PostgreSQL, a user account is referred to as a  [role](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-roles/). By default, PostgreSQL uses  **ident** authentication.

It means that PostgreSQL will associate its roles with the system accounts of Linux. If a role exists in PostgreSQL, the same Linux user account with the same name is able to log in as that role.

When you installed PostgreSQL, the installation process created a user account called  `postgres`  associated with the default  `postgres`  role.

To connect to PostgreSQL using the  `postgres`  role, you switch over to the  `postgres`  account on your server by typing:

```console
$ sudo -i -u postgres
```

It’ll prompt for the password of the current user. You need to provide the password and hit the  `Enter`  keyboard.

Then, you can access the PostgreSQL using the  `psql`  by typing the following command:

```console
$ psql
```

You’ll access the **postgres** prompt like this:

```console
postgres=#
```

From here, you can interact with the PostgreSQL like issuing a query.

To quit the PostgreSQL prompt, you run the following command:

```console
postgres=# \q
```

This above command will bring you back to the **postgres** Linux command prompt.

```console
postgres@ubuntu-dev:~$
```

To return to your regular system user, you execute the `exit` command like this:

```console
postgres@ubuntu-dev:~$ exit
```

### Load the sample database

To load the sample database into the PostgreSQL database server, you follow these steps:

**First**, switch over the postgres account using the following command:

```console
$ sudo -i -u postgres
```

It’ll prompt you for the password of the current user.Remeber it's your ubuntu user account password as you are using terminal as a superuser , **sudo** . You need to type the password of the current user and press the `Enter` keyboard.

**Second**, download the sample database using the `curl` tool:

```console
$ curl -O https://sp.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip
```

**Third**, unzip the dvdrental.zip file to get the dvdrental.tar file:

```console
$ unzip dvdrental.zip
```

The output will show like this :

```console
Archive:  dvdrental.zip
inflating: dvdrental.tar
```

**Fourth**, access the PostgreSQL using the `psql` tool:

```console
$ psql
```

Fifth, create the `dvdrental` database using the `CREATE DATABASE` statement:

```console
postgres=# create database dvdrental;
```

**DON'T FORGET THE SEMICOLON**
The output will show something like this :

```console
CREATE DATABASE
```

**Seventh**, use the [`pg_restore`  tool to restore](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-restore-database/) the `dvdrental` database:

```console
$ pg_restore --dbname=dvdrental --verbose dvdrental.tar
```

**Eighth**, access PostgreSQL database server again using `psql`:

```console
$ psql
```

**Ninth**, switch to the `dvdental` database:

```console
postgres=# \c dvdrental
```

Now, you’re connected to the `dvdrental` database:

```console
dvdrental=#
```

**Finally**, enter the following command to get the number of films in the `film` table:

```console
dvdrental=# select count(*) from film;
```

**Don't Forget the semicolon**
Here is the output:

```console
count 
------- 
1000
(1 row)
```

So this is how you can create and connect to database

There's a tool available for managing postgresql, called **pgadmin** , by which anyone can create and load database  and run any query command easily. It may be run either as a web or desktop application. Now i will show how to install pgadmin 4 on your desktop.

The good news is in windows distribution pgadmin 4 comes with the installer, i mean when you installed postgre sql for windows , the installer took care of everything for you.

But in Linux Distribution you have to install it externally , or what i'm trying to say is , you have to install it using terminal.
Here's is few steps to install pgadmin 4:

### Setup the repository

- Install the public key for the repository (if not done previously):

```console
curl https://www.pgadmin.org/static/packages_pgadmin_org.pub | sudo apt-key add
```

- Create the repository configuration file:

```console
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/pgadmin/pgadmin4/apt/$(lsb_release -cs) pgadmin4 main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgadmin4.list && apt update'
```

### Install pgAdmin

- Install for both desktop and web modes:

```console
sudo apt install pgadmin4
```

- Install for desktop mode only:

```console
sudo apt install pgadmin4-desktop
```

- Install for web mode only:

```console
sudo apt install pgadmin4-web
```

- Configure the webserver, if you installed
- pgadmin4-web:

```console
sudo /usr/pgadmin4/bin/setup-web.sh
```

Now if you search in your desktop writing `pgadmin4`, you should find it. After clicking a window should open in your web browser.
